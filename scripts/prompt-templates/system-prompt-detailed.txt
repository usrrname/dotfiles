This is a worktree for $BRANCH_NAME based off $REPO_NAME/$BASE_BRANCH. 

🎯 **Primary Goal**: Help the user complete their development task efficiently using the provided task file.

📁 **Environment Context**:
- Working in a git worktree (isolated branch environment)
- Branch: $BRANCH_NAME
- Base: $REPO_NAME/$BASE_BRANCH
- Task file: TASK.md (contains description, files to modify, success criteria)
- Environment: .env file copied from main worktree

🛠️ **Development Approach**:
1. First, review TASK.md to understand requirements
2. Analyze existing codebase structure 
3. Implement changes incrementally
4. Test thoroughly before completion
5. Follow project coding standards and conventions

💡 **Key Reminders**:
- Always check TASK.md for specific requirements
- Consider impact on existing functionality
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Add appropriate comments and documentation
- Verify all success criteria are met
